Create a Django application that allows users to create, view, update,
and delete posts. The application should have the following features:

1. User Registration: Users should be able to register an account by
providing a username and password.

2. User Login/Logout: Registered users can log in using their
credentials and log out when they are done.

3. Post Creation: Logged-in users can create new posts by entering a
title and content for the post.

4. Post Listing: All posts should be listed on the homepage with their
titles and creation dates displayed.

title, content, author name, and creation date.

6. Post Update/Delete: Only logged-in users who created a particular
post should be able to edit or delete it.
